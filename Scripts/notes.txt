THINGS TO ADD:
- death/stats screen (with retry or go to menu)
- makes menus navigable with keyboard
- put all text in a single file for easy translation
- translate the text to japanese
- finish entries for all enemies, gummies, events

THINGS TO FIX:
- the missile formations are currently tracking a missile to see if the event ends. if that missile is deleted it'll all probably break. Account for that.
(above should be fixed, though keep an eye out)

- shooter ambush still needs to be added to boss extras preview

current changes:
- horizontal boss spinner rebalancing
- fixed bug with homing missile not despawining between scenes
- added smaller screen flash for each gate destroyed
