THINGS TO ADD:
- death/stats screen (with retry or go to menu)
- makes menus navigable with keyboard
- put all text in a single file for easy translation
- translate the text to japanese
- finish entries for all enemies, gummies, events

THINGS TO FIX:
- the missile formations are currently tracking a missile to see if the event ends. if that missile is deleted it'll all probably break. Account for that.
(above should be fixed, though keep an eye out)

- move up is broken. THe multiplier from passing levels is only being applied
to the *existing* nodes. Not future ones.

- Need to clear homing missiles (and likely the other attacks too) after boss dies

current changes:
- bumper preview
- changed player velocity update method
