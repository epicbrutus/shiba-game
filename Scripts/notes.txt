-- the homing missile is just kinda broke when tunring so fix that

-- I deselected hte og falling player so you'll to reenable his group when you wanna use him.

THINGS TO FIX:
- gate is offset or something in normal mode
- missiles are not using the proper cooldown (I think. They seem fine in formation but not normally)
