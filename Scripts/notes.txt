THINGS TO ADD:
- death/stats screen (with retry or go to menu)
- makes menus navigable with keyboard
- put all text in a single file for easy translation
- translate the text to japanese
- finish entries for all enemies, gummies, events

THINGS TO FIX:
- the missile formations are currently tracking a missile to see if the event ends. if that missile is deleted it'll all probably break. Account for that.
(above should be fixed, though keep an eye out)

[X] shooter ambush still needs to be added to boss extras preview
[X] tutorial should show you can break through gates
- upwards and leftwards orientations
- translate to japanese
- food levels extras entries
- polish some of the extras entries
- more sound effects
- navigate menus with buttons
- give events an offset left/up depending on direction (for missile and laser formations; shouldn't hurt others)
