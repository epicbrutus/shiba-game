Cruise Missile was always jealous of its bigger brother, Homing Missile. He'd always boast of his superiority.
\"Cruise missile? Haven't heard that name in a long time,\" says Homing Missile, \"probably best kept that way. Dude couldn't turn if his life depended on it.\"

The worse part was Homing Missile was right: he was better. Turns out the ability to turn actually brings quite a significant increase in accuracy."
