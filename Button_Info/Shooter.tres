Most people who take this job don't do so by choice. Shooter is not most people.
\"When I first saw the job offer I was worried they wouldn't be evil enough,\" Shooter recalled, \"yeah, but luckily they're just as evil as they are on TV.\"

Unlike his colleagues, shooter never comes in late and never takes paid leave.\"

\"It's like I always say: 'if you love your job, you never work a day in your life'\""
