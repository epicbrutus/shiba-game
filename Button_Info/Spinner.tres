body = "A spinning blade.

The Spinner is a simple yet effective weapon. Though not as flashy as the Laser Gate or as speedy as the Cruise Missile, few can deny the efficiency of a giant blade. Though its mechanism is simple, the presence of the Bumper in its center raises many questions: is the Spinner merely a Bumper brandishing a weapon, or is the blade itself the Spinner merely wearing a Bumper, or are the two working together in a sort of symbiotic relationship? Best leave that one to the professionals."
