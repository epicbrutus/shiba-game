body = "Obstacle that damages anything that enters its beam.

The technology to produce those bright red hot lasers you see on TV that can cut through steel does indeed exist, and it's concentrated entirely inside this hole.
\"Some might find it disrespectful to be shut off from the world,\" posits Laser Gate,\"but I understand it's only because of the power I hold. It's flattering in its own way.\"

Countless researchers have been lost in the beam that the government has given up on making up excuses for their deaths, simply writing them off as caused by \"workplace incidents.\" A people have tried to look into it, but all have gone missing with nothing but a pile of ash in their place. How odd."
